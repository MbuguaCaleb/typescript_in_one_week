**What is TypeScript**

```
(a)It is a superset of the JavaScript programming Language.

It can be used as an alternative to the javascript programming Language in that it uses all the features that javascript has but however extends the functionality.


Extends the Langaage with new features and syntax.

(b)Browsers do not understand typescript by default.We therefore must convert our typeScript code into JavaScript inoder for browsers to understand it.


(c)Allows us to use Strict types..Thus extends javascript in that its easier to debug your code since you cannot reasign the variables.

(d very similar to the Babel JavaScript Feature.

(e)It also includes extra features that do not appear in JavaScript.(generics, interfaces,tuples etc)

It)When we use type Script we need to install the typescript compiler

(npm install -g typescript)

```

**Compiling TypeScript**

```
(a)Manually tsc sandbox.js

(b)Automatically tsc sandbox.ts -w

```

**Strict Types**

```
The main difference between JavaScript and TypeScript is that typeScript is strict on type.

This means that if i declare a variable as a string it Ts it shall always be a String unlike JavaScript which is much more dynamic.

we can do reassignment of variables but we can however never change the type.
