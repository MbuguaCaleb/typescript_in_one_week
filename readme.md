**What is TypeScript**

```
(a)It is a superset of the JavaScript programming Language.

It can be used as an alternative to the javascript programming Language in that it uses all the features that javascript has but however extends the functionality.


Extends the Langaage with new features and syntax.

(b)Browsers do not understand typescript by default.We therefore must convert our typeScript code into JavaScript inoder for browsers to understand it.


(c)Allows us to use Strict types..Thus extends javascript in that its easier to debug your code since you cannot reasign the variables.

(d very similar to the Babel JavaScript Feature.

(e)It also includes extra features that do not appear in JavaScript.(generics, interfaces,tuples etc)

It)When we use type Script we need to install the typescript compiler

(npm install -g typescript)

```

**Compiling TypeScript**
